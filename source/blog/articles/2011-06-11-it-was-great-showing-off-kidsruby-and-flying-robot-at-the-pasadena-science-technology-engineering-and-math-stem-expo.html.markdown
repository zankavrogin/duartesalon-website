Our latest blog post about KidsRuby is called ["It Was Great Showing Off KidsRuby and Flying Robot at the Pasadena Science Technology Engineering and Math STEM Expo"](http://www.kidsruby.com#2011-06-11) and is on the KidsRuby site.

Complete with UAV overflights with our video camera, our KidsRuby demo went great on Saturday, June 11 during the Pasadena Science Technology Engineering and Math (STEM) Expo.
