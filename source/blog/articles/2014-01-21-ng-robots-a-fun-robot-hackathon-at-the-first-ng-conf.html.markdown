Last week we headed to Salt Lake City, to participate in the AngularJS conference and Cylon.js proved invaluable during the hackathon for the JavaScript robots powered by Node.js.

A good summary of the event, including who the winners were and their prizes, is available in the post ["ng-robots! A Fun Robot Hackathon At The First ng-conf"](http://cylonjs.com/blog/2014/01/21/ng-robots-a-fun-robot-hackathon-at-the-first-ng-conf/) on the Cylon.js blog.
