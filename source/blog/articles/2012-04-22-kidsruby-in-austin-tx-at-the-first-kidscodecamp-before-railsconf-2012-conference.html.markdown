We wrote a post about KidsRuby called ["KidsRuby In Austin, TX, At The First KidsCodeCamp Before RailsConf 2012 Conference"](http://www.kidsruby.com#2012-04-22) on the KidsRuby site.

A great time was had by all on April 22, 2012 in Austin, TX in cooperation with the first KidsCodeCamp event taking place in participation with RailsConf 2012.
