As part of our commitment to Lean Development, we use Kanban to organize our project teams and keep clients informed. We created Kanbanpad at the Hybridgroup because we needed something that was simpler and more effective then any of the available tools, and we use it ourselves on a daily basis. Because of this, we realize what we need vs. what we don’t need. We felt like we really needed a way to organize all of our projects in a top-down view. So, drum-roll, we just released the organizations implementation of Kanbanpad. It’s really simple. Here’s a list of new features:

* You now have a dashboard that lists all your organizations, and personal kanbanpads.
* You now have the ability to create an organization.
* Organizations can invite collaborators on an organization-wide level basis.
* Kanbanpads can invite collaborators on a project specific basis.

Simply put, it’s a lot easier to manage a lot of kanbanpads at once now. We were having issues with having to remember private URL’s here and there, and now we have an easy way to see what we belong to, and what we’re working on.

So what are you waiting for? It’s free, so you might as well just go play with it now if you haven’t already.
