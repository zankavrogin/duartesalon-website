In a post called ["Thanks Baltimore, for An Awesome KidsRuby"](http://www.kidsruby.com#2011-05-16) we tell about a great KidsRuby class which you can read about on the KidsRuby site.

On Monday, May 16, we had one of our best KidsRuby events yet and were joined by an amazing group of young people who came in from Digital Harbor High School in Baltimore, Maryland in cooperation with BohConf 2011 and RailsConf 2011.
