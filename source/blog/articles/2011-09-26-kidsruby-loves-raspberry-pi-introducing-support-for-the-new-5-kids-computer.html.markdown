Read about how getting a computer to program with KidsRuby is now cheaper than ever in a post called ["KidsRuby Loves Raspberry Pi! Introducing Support For The New $25 Kids Computer"](http://www.kidsruby.com#2011-09-16) on the KidsRuby site.

We are extremely excited to announce that we have KidsRuby running on the new Raspberry Pi $25 computer, opening up many new possibilities for helping teach the next generation of programmers!
