Team Cylon.js has just returned from the amazing Makerland conference in Poland where we unveiled our latest JavaScript robotics technology featuring Human Machine Interfaces (HMI) and popsicle sticks. Not kidding!

We've just published a new tell-all post called ["Making Waves At Makerland"](http://cylonjs.com/blog/2014/03/24/making-waves-at-makerland/) on the Cylon.js web site.
