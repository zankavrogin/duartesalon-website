We were delighted to once again sponsor the Los Angeles Ruby Conference. With an amazing array of speakers, as well as the presence of so many remarkable attendees, we had a great time, as well as learned a lot.

The LA Ruby community has really grown, and we were so pleased to be a part of it.

Thanks again to all the attendees, speakers, ad other sponsors for making it possible!
