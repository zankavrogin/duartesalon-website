There is a new post called ["This One Goes To 0.11 Of Pure JavaScript"](http://cylonjs.com/blog/2014/03/04/this-one-goes-to-0.11-of-pure-javascript/) on the Cylon.js site about a recent refactor we've made to our JavaScript robotics platform's core.

Recently we decided to power-up Cylon.js and make a switch to 100% Javascript instead of using CoffeeScript.
