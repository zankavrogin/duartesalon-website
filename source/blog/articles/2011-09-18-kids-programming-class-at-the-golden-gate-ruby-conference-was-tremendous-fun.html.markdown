We wrote a post about a KidsRuby class in San Francisco called ["Kids Programming Class at the Golden Gate Ruby Conference Was Tremendous Fun"](http://www.kidsruby.com#2011-09-18) on the KidsRuby site.

A really fantastic class using KidsRuby was held in San Francisco on Sunday, September 18th in cooperation with the Golden Gate Ruby Conference, and a special thanks to those who helped organize it.
