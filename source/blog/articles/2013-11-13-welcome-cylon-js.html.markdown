Last month we introduced Cylon.js at the Idealab in Pasadena, CA and it is quickly becoming the most powerful framework in JavaScript for robotics and physical computing. 

We present to you Cylon.js in a blog post we've made called ["Welcome, Cylon.js"](http://cylonjs.com/blog/2013/11/13/welcome-cylon-js/) on the Cylon.js web site.
