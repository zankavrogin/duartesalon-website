You can read about  our KidsRuby class at BarcampLA in a post called ["The Kids Programming Class at BarcampLA Was Excellent"](http://www.kidsruby.com#2011-05-01) on the KidsRuby site.

Last Sunday, May 1, we had another great turnout at the KidsRuby class in Los Angeles, California, in cooperation with BarCampLA and we were joined by a few "big kids" as well.
