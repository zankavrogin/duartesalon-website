We wrote a post about KidsRuby called ["A Fantastic Time Had By All at KidsRuby in Bend, Oregon"](http://www.kidsruby.com#2011-03-26) on the KidsRuby site.

G5 provided us with a great venue for the fantastic KidsRuby class in Bend, Oregon on March 26th, and thanks to all the local Rubyists who came out to help!
