Last week was the amazing 10th year of RubyConf aka “RubyConf X”, and The Hybrid Group was privileged to participate as a conference sponsor. Our own Daniel Fischer (@dfischer) and Ron Evans (@deadprogram) were in attendance, and @deadprogram was giving his talk “How To Jam In Code” for the first time ever in English. Go figure!

From thought-provoking keynotes, to the hallway conversations, RubyConf is the singularly most important gathering of Rubyists there is. Check out @deadprogram’s blog post “10 Cool Things From RubyConf X” for more details.

We also had a great time talking up our lean project management tool Kanban Pad at the conference. Many people had already seen it, and we got lots of useful feedback. Thank you to everyone who spent some time talking to us about it.

RubyConf was a great chance for us to give back to the community that has been a big part of our success, and we were very glad to be a part of it. See you all next year!
