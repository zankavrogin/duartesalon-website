We've just pushed a post about Cylon.js called ["Intro Robeaux- A Universal User Interface To Robotic Devices"](http://cylonjs.com/blog/2014/02/06/intro-robeaux-a-universal-user-interface-to-robotic-devices/) on the Cylon.js site.

With the latest update, the API has been greatly improved and now there's even more hardware support in our JavaScript open source robotics platform.
