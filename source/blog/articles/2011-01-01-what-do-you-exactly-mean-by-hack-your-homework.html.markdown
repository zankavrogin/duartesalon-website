We wrote a post about hacking your homework called ["What do you exactly mean by hack your homework"](http://www.kidsruby.com#2011-01-14-1) on the KidsRuby site.

When we say "hack your homework" we mean "learn how to write a computer program to help you with your homework," not to be confused with the term "crack" which usually means something bad.
