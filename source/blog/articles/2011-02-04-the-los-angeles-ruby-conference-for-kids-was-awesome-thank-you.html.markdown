We wrote a post about KidsRuby and the LA Ruby Conference called ["The Los Angeles Ruby Conference for Kids Was Awesome, Thank You"](http://www.kidsruby.com#2011-02-04) on the KidsRuby site.

 We taught our first class using nothing but KidsRuby in Los Angeles on February 4th, in cooperation with the Los Angeles Ruby Conference and it was an excellent class thanks to everyone invovled!
