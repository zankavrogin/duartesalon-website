We wrote about the latest Cylon.js release which allows for multiple and simultaneous platform support in a new post ["Release 0.8.0 Makes 10 Platforms"](http://cylonjs.com/blog/2013/12/16/release-0.8.0-makes-10-platforms/) on the Cylon.js site.

Cylon.js version 0.8.0 is here, allowing anyone to quickly add new hardware platforms and making it easier for our collaborators and implementors to add support to the new JavaScript platform for robotics.
