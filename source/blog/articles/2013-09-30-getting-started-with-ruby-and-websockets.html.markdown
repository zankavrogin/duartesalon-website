The Hybrid Group's own Andrew Stewart has written a new article about Ruby and Websockets called ["Getting Started with Ruby and WebSockets"](https://blog.engineyard.com/2013/getting-started-with-ruby-and-websockets) on the Engine Yard Blog.

In this post, he gives an introduction to WebSockets, the HTML5 spec which allows for clients and servers to communicate without using AJAX requests or HTTP long-polling (Comet), and implements a basic WebSockets chat app using EM-WebSocket.
