Team Cylon will be heading to Dreamforce next week where we will show how devices can provide real-time business information and how developers can start making use of these technologies. 

You can read about how we are helping to build the "Internet of Things" in the post ["Dreamforce Is Coming!"](http://cylonjs.com/blog/2013/11/15/dreamforce-is-coming/) on the Cylon.js site.
